    "#### Roster Form\n",
    "\n",
    "In the roster form, the elements of a set are listed within curly brackets. For example, $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large sets can be defined by listing the first few elements, followed by ellipses ($\\ldots$) and the last element. For example, $\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 100\\}$ is the set of all natural numbers from 1 to 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Infinite sets can be defined by listing the first few elements, followed by ellipses ($\\ldots$). For example, $A = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ is the set of all non-negative integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set-Builder Form\n",
    "\n",
    "In the set-builder form, the elements of a set are defined by a property that they satisfy. Consider the set of $x$ that have certain property $P$. This set can be denoted as $\\{x \\mid x \\text{ has property } P\\}$. The vertical bar \"$\\mid$\" is read as \"such that\". \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the set of all $x$ in the interval $[0, 1]$ can be defined as $\\{x \\mid 0 \\leq x \\leq 1\\}$. Similarly, the set of all integers that are at least 5 and less than 10 can be defined as $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid 5 \\leq x < 10\\}$. Here, $\\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the set of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Special Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{Z}$: The set of integers, $\\{\\ldots, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$.\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{N}$: The set of natural numbers, $\\{0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$. Some definitions include 0 in the set of natural numbers, while others do not.\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{Q}$: The set of rational numbers, $\\left\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x = a/b, \\text{ where } a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\text{ and } b \\neq 0\\right\\}$.\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{R}$: The set of real numbers.\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{R}^+$: The set of positive real numbers, $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x > 0\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relations and Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Equality**: Two sets are equal if they have the same elements. For example, $\\{1, 2, 3\\} = \\{3, 2, 1\\}$. \n",
    "- **Subset**: A set $A$ is a subset of a set $B$ if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$. This is denoted as $A \\subseteq B$. If $A$ is a subset of $B$ but not equal to $B$, it is denoted as $A \\subset B$.\n",
    "- **Superset**: $A \\supseteq B$ means $B \\subseteq A$. Similarly, $A \\supset B$ means $B \\subset A$.\n",
    "- **Union**: The union of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of elements that are in $A$, in $B$, or in both. It is denoted as $A \\cup B$. For example, if $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $B = \\{3, 4, 5\\}$, then $A \\cup B = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n",
    "- **Intersection**: $A \\cap B$ is the set of elements that are in both $A$ and $B$. For example, if $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $B = \\{3, 4, 5\\}$, then $A \\cap B = \\{3\\}$.\n",
    "- **Difference**: $A - B$ is the set of elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$. For example, if $A = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $B = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$, then $A - B = \\{1, 3\\}$. Sometimes, this is denoted as $A \\setminus B$.\n",
    "- **Complement**: Let $\\Omega$ be the universal set. The complement of a set $A$ is the set of elements in $\\Omega$ that are not in $A$. It is denoted as $A^c$ or $\\bar{A}$. Using set difference, $A^c = \\Omega - A$."
